# Titanic EDA Analysis 🛳️

## 📌 Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

### 🧠 Description:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, understand feature distributions, handle missing data, and explore relationships between variables that influenced passenger survival.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
- Handle missing values effectively
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualize relationships using plots
- Use correlation heatmaps to find trends

---

### 💼 Internship Experience:
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at [Coding Samurai](https://www.codingsamurai.in/)**, where I am gaining hands-on experience in real-world data analytics and machine learning projects.
